# Data transformation

## Read Data

The Scrata's API (an official third-party provider that powers NYC Open Data) provides a query language called the “Socrata Query Language” or “SoQL”. See technical details [here](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries/). With carefully designed queries, we can pull down data which are pre-processed on the server side. 


Variables included in the dataset on new business license applications.
```{r}
#install.packages("RSocrata")
library("RSocrata") # read data using API
license = read.socrata("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/ptev-4hud.json?$where=start_date between '2017-01-01' and '2021-05-01' and city='NEW YORK'")
str(license)
```

Variables included in the dataset on legally operating businesses.
```{r}
business = read.socrata("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/w7w3-xahh.json?$where=lic_expir_dd between '2020-01-01' and '2021-05-01' and address_state='NY' and license_status='Active'")
str(business)
```
