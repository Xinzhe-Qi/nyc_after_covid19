[["index.html", "NYC after COVID-19 Chapter 1 Introduction", " NYC after COVID-19 Kenny Lee, Xinzhe Qi 2021-04-12 Chapter 1 Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has left indelible marks on New York City. On Sunday, March 14 2021, New Yorkers marked a year since the first registered fatalities from the pandemic. The city has come a long way since the onset of the pandemic, but there is definitely a long winding path ahead to full recovery. We hope to measure the city’s recovery since then. There are many questions to be answered. Which neighborhoods recovered fast and which neighborhoods did not? Are there other geographic, demographic and economic factors that may have affected the strength of the rebound in activity in a neighborhood? We use NYC’s data on operating business licenses as well as applications for new licenses to assess economic recovery since the onset of the pandemic. To enrich our analysis, we draw Census Bureau’s ACS data to incorporate other demographic and economic data. These values can be control variables when we compare the changes in trends and demographics across the neighborhoods in NYC. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 NYC OpenData 2.2 The US Census Bureau’s American Community Survey 2.3 NYC Geographies", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 NYC OpenData Context NYC OpenData is a data portal maintained by New York City. With a common set of standards and guidelines across the city’s numerous agencies, NYC OpenData offers thousands of high-quality data for public use. For our project, we look at the following two datasets on business licenses and applications from the NYC Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA). The business license application data will give us information on business formation in NYC. The DCA collects applications for a license from businesses or individuals. The licensees are required to display this document and license number. The dataset contains detailed information such as the business location and applicant’s information such as application ID and related contact information. These data can be used to identify businesses and individuals in industries requiring a DCA-issued license. Each row in the dataset represents each record of the DCA-issued license and its current status. Legally operating businesses in NYC (weekly data by zipcode &amp; census tract from the municipal government) Description: The data feature businesses/individuals holding a DCA license to legally operate in New York City. Sightseeing guides and temporary street fair vendors are not included. Number of variables included: 29 Applications for new business licenses in NYC (weekly data by zipcode) Description: The data features license applications received during the past few years, including applications where a license was issued, denied, withdrawn, or remains pending. This data set is updated on a weekly basis. Number of variables included: 25 Acquisition We can get this data using the official NYC OpenData API which is powered by a third-party tool called Socrata. Socrata offers a robust query language to pre-process data on the server side. Limitation Companies and individuals can file for licenses from an address that is not in any of the five boroughs. The exact location of the business within NYC cannot be exactly confirmed. DCA only publishes the city, state, and postal Code of the mailing address for individual licenses. 2.2 The US Census Bureau’s American Community Survey Context Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) offers high-quality information on a wide range of topics such as educational attainment, living situation, and income distribution. The ACS provides local community leaders vital social and economic information for policy decisions. Unlike the decennial census, the ACS is conducted on a yearly basis to provide more timely information. Acquisition The ACS data can be downloaded directly from here by browsing through the list of pre-generated tables. The Census Bureau offers an API access. The detailed user guide can be found here. We use the tidycensus package to download data more efficiently. Limitation The limitation of the ACS is that it is unavailable on a higher frequency. 2.3 NYC Geographies Newman Library at Baruch College, a school within the City University of New York, offers extensive work on maps and geographical crosswalks between various geographical units within NYC. Here’s the source. In addition, we used a shapefile from NYC Planning Department to create choropleth maps. All official shapefiles for different geographical units can be found here. These files come in a GeoJSON format and match well with the delineation created by the Census Bureau. No additional cleaning is necessary. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Read Data", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Read Data 3.1.1 Processing business license data from NYC OpenData The Scrata’s API (an official third-party provider that powers NYC Open Data) provides a query language called the “Socrata Query Language” or “SoQL”. See technical details here. With carefully designed queries, we can pull down data which are pre-processed on the server side. For example, the following query will download data from January 2017 to May 2021 (or latest available) with the filing address in NY state. library(&quot;RSocrata&quot;) # load the RSocrata package license = read.socrata( &quot;https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/ptev-4hud.json?$where=start_date between &#39;2017-01-01&#39; and &#39;2021-05-01&#39; and state=&#39;NY&#39;&quot;) Note that the source data do not offer clean information where the business is actually located as licensees can register with any mailing or permanent address that need not be in NYC. The below shows the first ten unique values of the city of the licenses filed between October and December 2019. As NYC Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) does not fix idiosyncratic inputs by licensees, the geographical units are not uniform across the records. ## [1] &quot;MOUNT VERNON&quot; &quot;NEW WINDSOR&quot; &quot;BROOKLYN&quot; &quot;CHICAGO&quot; ## [5] &quot;JAMAICA&quot; &quot;NEW YORK&quot; &quot;MIDDLE VILLAGE&quot; &quot;BRONX&quot; ## [9] &quot;SAINT ALBANS&quot; &quot;HEMPSTEAD&quot; Given this limitation, we cannot track down where the businesses are exactly located in the city. However, we can still narrow our analysis to those that were filed from addresses in NYC. Setting this filter on the data can help us focus on the entrepreneurism of the city’s residents. With the help of the zip-code-to-borough mapping by Baruch College, we picked the records that match the list of zip codes corresponding to the five boroughs in NYC (Manhattan, Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn and Stetan Island). Moreover, various contact information which is not needed in this analysis was removed for privacy as well as to keep the data size small. In addition, we disregard a small sample of applications that are denied, withdrawn, or pending. The vast majority of these cases are due to errors made by the applicants while filling out the DCA form. At this stage, we do not drop any rows or columns with missing values. 3.1.2 Getting Census Bureau’s American Community Survey data with API As mentioned in the previous chapter, the Census Bureau offers an API access. The detailed user guide can be found here. We use the tidycensus package to download data more efficiently. One must obtain a unique key to interact with API using this link. The tidycensus package offers easy-to-use functions to download the data and control parameters for geographies and a survey vintage. For our exercise, we used 2019 ACS single-year estimates. Instead of explaining how to use the tidycensus package in detail, we included sample R codes that we used to process the data in our repository. A static version of the resulting data file from the codes is also in our repository. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Most missing values in our pre-processed business application dataset are concentrated in variables related to business address details such as building unit or office suite number. Within variables that we care about the most such as zip codes, application status, and broader geographical unit the applicant is located in, missing values are non-existent. The bar chart below features variable names with most missing values in a descending order from top to bottom. Other variables that are not shown here do not have any missing values. The information in variables with missing values fortunately carries little importance in our analysis. For all of the small number of observations where city (representing the neighborhood-level jurisdiction of an area where applicants are located in), zip code values are present that help us map to a broader area for aggregation. In addition, we use the extracat package for analyzing the pattern in missing data.1 The main area in the chart below shows all combination of missing values across columns and rows. The gray horizontal columns in the right-most area show the frequency of respective row-wise patterns. The magenta vertical bars in the bottom area show the frequency of column-wise patterns. This graphical analysis indicates that the most frequent missing pattern is the one where an applicant did not provide any input for the second street address (street_2), additional description of the location of the business (description), unit number (unit) and unit type (unit_type). The second most frequent pattern lacks additional information on geographical coordinates (longitude &amp; latitude) and street name (street). These patterns likely reflect the fact that individual applicants are free to set up a business anywhere in the city, regardless of the address used when filing. As this package is currently unavailable in CRAN, we used an archived package from Prof. Joyce Robbins’ repository.↩︎ "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Searching for trends 5.2 Scaling the impact of the pandemic 5.3 Do demographic factors matter in recovery? 5.4 Operating businesses in NYC", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Searching for trends The line chart below shows historical changes in newly approved license application volumes from 2017 to March 2021, aggregated to monthly frequency and mapped to five boroughs by zip codes. The shading represents the period since the onset of the pandemic. Across the five boroughs, the impact of the pandemic is clearly visible, with new applications dropping sharply around the end-March of 2020. The troughs of this sharp drop were in April 2020 during the first lockdowns in spring. Afterward, the volume of new licenses has improved steadily in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens. The volume in Staten Island, however, did not show much improvement. Over the winter, NYC including Staten Island saw substantial increases in newly approved licenses. 5.1.1 New application vs. renewal In the preceding chart, there are distinct jumps in applications close to end-2017 and end-2019. The two year gap between the two spikes of very similar magnitude suggests a cyclical factor driving this behavior. It turns out that most of these jumps are driven by a large flow of applications for renewals of special licenses such as home improvement contracting and sales businesses. According to the city regulation, home improvement contractors must renew their licenses every two years. The license data indicate there are 60 industries that the city grants licenses to. The bar chart below shows top 10 industries that receive licenses from the city since 2016, as a percent share of the total number approved licenses (there are about 185 thousand records across 60 industries). Among those, home improvement is at the top, accounting for more than 15% of all licenses authorized. Excluding renewal applications, the damage of the pandemic on the local economy appears more starkly (see chart below). Applications for new business licenses dropped sharply and the recovery so far appears weak. Starting a new business takes a lot of resources and risk. Uncertain business outlook due to the ongoing pandemic probably discouraged many potential new businesses from entering the market. The shaded region in the chart denotes the period since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020. Moreover, the chart highlights the uneven recovery among the five boroughs. While Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan showed improvement over last summer and winter, the recovery in the Bronx and Staten Island lags other boroughs. Note that the spike in authorized applications for new licenses close to the end of 2017 was due to a change in city regulation governing licenses for laundry businesses, rather than a meaningful jump in demand for this business. It is also noteworthy that large shares of applications for new licenses originate from outer-boroughs, which contradict a common perception that Manhattan is the business district of the city. The bar chart below shows that Brooklyn and Queens led approved applications for new licenses since 2016. Here, bars corresponding to boroughs are arranged in descending order. 5.1.2 Seasonality in data Time series of business data often display seasonality. We first show the time series of applications for new licenses in all of NYC by year in one chart. The lines for 2020 and 2021 are substantially below the lines for other years, reflecting the impact of the pandemic. The data for November 2017 through April 2018 were affected by a one-off change in license regulation, as discussed above. Overall, the chart below indicates new business application tends to rise in spring and gradually slows over the summer and winter. Afterward, we aggregate these lines together by month to summarize seasonal behavior by month. Below, we summarize the seasonal behavior of the data by month using a subset of the data between 2016 and 2019 as the pandemic brought a shift in trend in our data in 2020. This chart shows a seasonal pattern more succinctly. The median value for each month, represented by the horizontal line in each box, is a good proxy for the seasonal pattern of the data. High upper whiskers in April and November are due to distortions caused by policy changes in the period between November 2017 and April 2018. 5.2 Scaling the impact of the pandemic To measure the impact of the pandemic, we need a baseline, estimated during the period prior to the pandemic. We calculate monthly baseline levels by borough by taking the median count of approved applications for new licenses by month between 2016 and 2019. For example, the baseline level of approved business applications for Brooklyn in March is calculated as the median of the sums of approved applications for new licenses in Brooklyn respectively in March 2016, March 2017, March 2018, and March 2019. The impact of the pandemic is calculated as the percent difference from these monthly median values by borough. By comparing the more recent data month by month to the baseline, we can estimate the impact of the pandemic while avoiding seasonal distortions. The resulting metrics are shown below. The chart above highlights a substantial drop in newly approved licenses during the spring lockdown in 2020. While these measures have improved since then, they remain at a very low level across the five boroughs, suggesting a long road to recovery for NYC. 5.3 Do demographic factors matter in recovery? Against the backdrop of accelerating vaccine distribution, we hope to examine the relationship between demographic variables and recovery since the spring lockdown in 2020. We draw demographic information from the Census Bureau’s latest 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) corresponding to NYC Community Districts, which roughly correspond to areas commonly known as “neighborhoods.” We used these disaggregated data instead of borough level aggregates for a more robust analysis as there are 55 Community Districts in total. The three demographic variables from the ACS we consider are Broadband: Percent of households in a region with a broadband internet access, Education: Percent of population aged 25+ with bachelors’ degree or higher, Poverty: Percent of people living below the federally defined poverty threshold. To examine the relationship between these variables and the recovery in the volume of approved license applications for new businesses, we first constructed measures of the pandemic impact on applications for new business licenses for each of 55 neighborhoods following the same methodology that we used to calculate the measures for the five boroughs. To measure the “recovery” in each area, we take the difference between the average levels of the impact during April-June 2020 and January-March 2021. The chart below shows scatterplots of the demographic variables listed above and the recovery by neighborhood, with lines representing best fits estimated with simple least square estimators. The chart above indicates that the best fit lines with Education and Broadband as explanatory variables and recovery since April-June 2020 are downward sloping. That is, the higher the percent share of the population with education level at or above bachelor’s degree and the percent share of households with high-speed broadband access, the lower the recovery has been. With poverty as an explanatory variable, the best fit line is upward sloping, meaning that the higher the share of the population living under poverty, the stronger the recovery has been. This result may sound counterintuitive to some. However, this result could be due to the fact that many NYC residents with more financial resources have exited the city during the extended period of lockdown since spring 2020. The following chart is a choropleth map of NYC with the fill color showing the degree of recovery since spring 2020. This chart shows that while neighborhoods outside Manhattan may have been initially hit more harshly by the pandemic, their recovery since spring 2020 has been more robust than neighborhoods in Manhattan. In particular, neighborhoods that are relatively residential compared to others, usually farther out in the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn have shown stronger recoveries. The recovery in neighborhoods that are more commercial such as Financial District and Downtown Brooklyn is lagging, reflecting a shift in lifestyle since the pandemic. With a large share of office workers yet to return to offices, the recovery in these areas might take longer. Note that the neighborhood boundary lines mapped above follow the Census Bureau’s Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA). While NYC neighborhoods generally correlate with PUMA, some multiple neighborhoods can be bucketed together into one larger PUMA. Check this link for an official mapping between Community Districts and PUMA by NYC officials. 5.4 Operating businesses in NYC Here we investigate the number of operating businesses in NYC, using previous four years as references. As we can see that operating businesses with NYC mailing addresses are declining over years, and 2020 shows the most dramatic decline of all, starting from March. Note that the numbers here only shows the businesses with NYC mailing addresses, so there could be many cases where the mailing addresses are out of NYC but still operate in NYC. Even so, we can still see a clear severe impact on these businesses since pandemic. We find that within NYC, business license type is more common than licenses filed by individuals. In addition, a large majority of the licenses are issued in Bronx and Brooklyn. Surprisingly, there is no record from Staten Island. The lack of the entire borough suggests a potential data quality problem. It is also somewhat odd that there are so few records from Manhattan and Queens. We suspect that a possible explanation could be many of the license holders filed their initial paperwork using the addresses that are not in NYC. Those records will get dropped out during our data cleaning process. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component Here is an interactive bar plot showing the categories of the operating businesses in NY. We can see that the top ones are Home Improvement Contractor, Tabacco Retail, and Electronics. Hovering over the bars will show you the exact numbers of each industry. The following is the choropleth map where the fill color is the degree of recovery since spring 2020. The darker blue indicates weaker recovery, while the brighter color indicates stronger recovery. While this choropleth map is similar to the version presented in the earlier chapter (note color scheme has been flipped), it complements the earlier version by providing additional dimensions of information. A user can hover over each area to query the name of the area and demographic information alongside the estimate of recovery since spring 2020. Recovery since spring 2020 Area: Recovery since spring 2020 (percentage point): Population under poverty (%): Household with high-speed internet access (%): 25+ Population with bachelor’s degree or higher (%): The code to create the continuous color legend was adapted from this blog post. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion The data on new and existing business licenses highlight the severe impact of the pandemic in the city. The data on approved licenses for new businesses display seasonal fluctuation. Looking through seasonal variation, they declined substantially across the five boroughs of the city due to the raging pandemic. The data on currently operating business licenses also show a notable drop-off in 2020 through 2021. While most regions showed some recovery since the onset of the pandemic, the recovery in some neighborhoods is slower than in other areas. Interestingly, the areas that showed a stronger rebound in new business license applications are neighborhoods that are father in the outer-boroughs, which tend to display higher poverty rates, lower educational attainment rates, and less widespread access to high-speed internet. This is possibly due to an abrupt shift in lifestyle with more prevalent remote work. Still, many office workers in the city’s commercial neighborhoods have yet to return, implying a slower recovery in these areas. The limitation of this exercise is that the datasets from the NYC Department of Consumer Affairs lack where these new and existing businesses are located, which makes it difficult to verify what the data seem to indicate in real life. The numbers we used for our analyses only include the businesses with NYC mailing addresses. Since there could be many businesses still operating in NYC while having non-NYC mailing addresses, our analyses could be underestimating the impact of the pandemic as well as the ensuing recovery. Moreover, there could be some cases in which the business owner’s licenses are considered active in our operating business dataset although the business has already closed as administrative data tend to get updated with a lag. There are certainly other alternative sources of information that can enrich our analysis further. Google’s Community Mobility Report, for example, measures resident mobility by venue type (e.g., offices vs. recreational services), based on user location data. This additional information could add another dimension to analyzing the impact of the pandemic. "]]
