On Sunday, March 14 2021, New Yorkers marked a year since the first registered fatalities from the pandemic. The city has come a long way since the onset of the pandemic, but there is definitely a long winding path ahead to full recovery. We hope to measure the city’s recovery since then. There are many questions to be answered. Which neighborhoods recovered fast and which neighborhoods did not? Are there other geographic, demographic and economic factors that may have affected the strength of the rebound in activity in a neighborhood? We use NYC’s weekly data on regional operating business licenses to compare trends immediately before the pandemic (Jan-Feb 2020), the peak of the pandemic (Apr-Mar 2020) and a period of recovery (Jan-Feb 2021). To enrich our analysis, we draw Census Bureau’s ACS data to incorporate other demographic and economic data. These values can be control variables when we compare the changes in trends and demographics across the neighborhoods in NYC. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 NYC OpenData 2.2 The US Census Bureau’s American Community Survey 2.3 NYC Geographies", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 NYC OpenData Context NYC OpenData is a data portal maintained by New York City. With a common set of standards and guidelines across the city’s numerous agencies, NYC OpenData offers thousands of high-quality data for public use. For our project, we look at the following two datasets on business licenses and applications from the NYC Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA). The business license application data will give us information on business formation in NYC. The DCA collects applications for a license from businesses or individuals. The licensees are required to display this document and license number. The dataset contains detailed information such as the business location and applicant’s information such as application ID and related contact information. These data can be used to identify businesses and individuals in industries requiring a DCA-issued license. Each row in the dataset represents each record of the DCA-issued license and its current status. Legally operating businesses in NYC (weekly data by zipcode &amp; census tract from the municipal government) Description: The data feature businesses/individuals holding a DCA license to legally operate in New York City. Sightseeing guides and temporary street fair vendors are not included. Number of variables included: 29 Applications for new business licenses in NYC (weekly data by zipcode) Description: The data features license applications received during the past few years, including applications where a license was issued, denied, withdrawn, or remains pending. This data set is updated on a weekly basis. Number of variables included: 25 Acquisition We can get this data using the official NYC OpenData API which is powered by a third-party tool called Socrata. Socrata offers a robust query language to pre-process data on the server side. Limitation Companies and individuals can file for licenses from an address that is not in any of the five boroughs. The exact location of the business within NYC cannot be exactly confirmed. DCA only publishes the city, state, and postal Code of the mailing address for individual licenses. 2.2 The US Census Bureau’s American Community Survey Census Bureau’s ACS data 2.3 NYC Geographies Newman Library at Baruch College, a school within the City University of New York, offers extensive work on maps and geographical crosswalks between various geographical units within NYC. Here’s the source. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Read Data", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Read Data 3.1.1 Processing business license data from NYC OpenData The Scrata’s API (an official third-party provider that powers NYC Open Data) provides a query language called the “Socrata Query Language” or “SoQL”. See technical details here. With carefully designed queries, we can pull down data which are pre-processed on the server side. For example, the following query will download data from January 2017 to May 2021 (or latest available) with the filing address in NY state. library(&quot;RSocrata&quot;) # load the RSocrata package license = read.socrata( &quot;https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/ptev-4hud.json?$where=start_date between &#39;2017-01-01&#39; and &#39;2021-05-01&#39; and state=&#39;NY&#39;&quot;) Note that the source data do not offer clean information where the business is actually located as licensees can register with any mailing or permanent address that need not be in NYC. The below shows the first ten unique values of the city of the licenses filed between October and December 2019. As NYC Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) does not fix idiosyncratic inputs by licensees, the geographical units are not uniform across the records. ## [1] &quot;MOUNT VERNON&quot; &quot;NEW WINDSOR&quot; &quot;BROOKLYN&quot; &quot;CHICAGO&quot; ## [5] &quot;JAMAICA&quot; &quot;NEW YORK&quot; &quot;MIDDLE VILLAGE&quot; &quot;BRONX&quot; ## [9] &quot;SAINT ALBANS&quot; &quot;HEMPSTEAD&quot; Given this limitation, we cannot track down where the businesses are exactly located in the city. However, we can still narrow our analysis to those that were filed from addresses in NYC. Setting this filter on the data can help us focus on the entrepreneurism of the city’s residents. With the help of the zip-code-to-borough mapping by Baruch College, we picked the records that match the list of zip codes corresponding to the five boroughs in NYC (Manhattan, Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn and Stetan Island). Moreover, various contact information which is not needed in this analysis was removed for privacy as well as to keep the data size small. In addition, we disregard a small sample of applications that are denied, withdrawn, or pending. The vast majority of these cases are due to errors made by the applicants while filling out the DCA form. At this stage, we do not drop any rows or columns with missing values. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Most missing values in our pre-processed business application dataset are concentrated in variables related to business address details such as building unit or office suite number. Within variables that we care about the most such as zip codes, application status, and broader geographical unit the applicant is located in, missing values are non-existent. The bar chart below features variable names with most missing values in a descending order from top to bottom. Other variables that are not shown here do not have any missing values. The information in variables with missing values fortunately carries little importance in our analysis. For all of the small number of observations where city (representing the neighborhood-level jurisdiction of an area where applicants are located in), zip code values are present that help us map to a broader area for aggregation. In addition, we use the extracat package for analyzing the pattern in missing data.1 The main area in the chart below shows all combination of missing values across columns and rows. The gray horizontal columns in the right-most area show the frequency of respective row-wise patterns. The magenta vertical bars in the bottom area show the frequency of column-wise patterns. This graphical analysis indicates that the most frequent missing pattern is the one where an applicant did not provide any input for the second street address (street_2), additional description of the location of the business (description), unit number (unit) and unit type (unit_type). The second most frequent pattern lacks additional information on geographical coordinates (longitude &amp; latitude) and street name (street). These patterns likely reflect the fact that individual applicants are free to set up a business anywhere in the city, regardless of the address used when filing. As this package is currently unavailable in CRAN, we used an archived package from Prof. Joyce Robbins’ repository.↩︎ "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Searching for trends", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Searching for trends The line chart below shows historical changes in newly approved license application volumes from 2017 to March 2021, aggregated to monthly frequency and mapped to five boroughs by zip codes. The shading represents the period since the onset of the pandemic. Across the five boroughs, the impact of the pandemic is clearly visible, with new applications dropping sharply around the end-March of 2020. The troughs of this sharp drop were in April 2020 during the first lockdowns in spring. Afterward, the volume of new licenses has improved steadily in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens. The volume in Staten Island, however, did not show much improvement. Over the winter, NYC including Staten Island saw substantial increases in newly approved licenses. 5.1.1 New application vs. renewal In the preceding chart, there are distinct jumps in applications close to end-2017 and end-2019. The two year gap between the two spikes of very similar magnitude suggests a cyclical factor driving this behavior. It turns out that most of these jumps are driven by a large flow of applications for renewals of special licenses such as home improvement contracting and sales businesses. According to the city regulation, home improvement contractors must renew their licenses every two years. Excluding renewal applications, the damage of the pandemic on the local economy appears more starkly (see chart below). Applications for new business licenses dropped sharply and the recovery so far appears weak. Starting a new business takes a lot of resources and risk. Uncertain business outlook due to the ongoing pandemic probably discouraged many potential new businesses from entering the market. The shaded region in the chart denotes the period since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020. Moreover, the chart highlights the uneven recovery among the five boroughs. While Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan showed improvement over last summer and winter, the recovery in the Bronx and Staten Island lags other boroughs. Note that the spike in authorized applications for new licenses close to the end of 2017 was due to a change in city regulation governing licenses for laundry businesses, rather than a meaningful jump in demand for this business. It is also noteworthy that large shares of applications for new licenses originate from outer-boroughs, which contradict a common perception that Manhattan is the business district of the city. The bar chart below shows that Brooklyn and Queens led approved applications for new licenses since 2016. Here, bars corresponding to boroughs are arranged in a descending order. 5.1.2 Seasonality in data Time series of business data often display seasonality. As the pandemic brought a shift in trend in our data, we subset the data between 2016 and 2019 and plot the subseries by month to visually identify a seasonal pattern.
